# scrambles

scrambles is a simple tool to create a complex wordlist by combining some word and character using a set of rules.

brute forcing a password can be a pain especialy without a proper wordlist, but the existing wordlist scather aroud the internet can't help much, eather because its to small or using a different language. there is plenty of word list generator out there but almost all of them is creating a random result with termandous size or need a complicated setting to operate. 

scrambles uses a manualy created small but spesific wordlist as a source to create a complex one by combining and mismaching entry from the it with a set of rule. the idea is to create a wordlist thats spesificly target a certain word and caracter without the needs to burn your computer or typing all posibble combination manualy.
